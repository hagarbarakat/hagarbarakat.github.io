## WalkThrough :footprints:	
Hola,  
 I'm Hagar Barakat, an enthusiastic software engineering student.  
 The aim of this repo is to show off my latest work and my all time favorite projects.  
 Through last year, I worked twice as a freelance software developer. My first application was a desktop java application used by a restaurant in order to store customersâ€™ orders and information for the restaurant. MYSQL, JavaFX, and AWS Database were the technologies used for this project. And my second application was Axis mobile application which was for a startup based on food delivery, and my task was to implement an android application that stores information about customers and markets through cloud firestore and pushing notifications through Cloud messaging. Java, Android Studio, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Messaging, Firebase Authentication, and Google Maps were the technologies used for this application. 
## Working on :woman_technologist:	
 Right now, I am working on a To-do List android widget and I am enrolled in operating system implementation course in which I am implementing xinu os.
